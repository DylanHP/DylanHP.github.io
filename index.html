				<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Hi, I'm Dylan Zanaglio, an <b>Electronic Engineering student</b> at <b>UNIBS</b> (University of
					Brescia) with a
					deep passion for <b>electronics</b>, <b>embedded systems</b>, <b>innovation</b>, and
					<b>Motorsport</b>.
				</p>
				<p>I am always eager to explore new technologies, electronic design methodologies, and programming
					techniques. My studies and hands-on experience have allowed me to work on <b>hardware projects</b>,
					develop
					<b>embedded firmware</b>, and design <b>circuits</b>. I thrive on tackling challenges and pushing
					the boundaries
					of technology. As the <b>team lead</b> of the electronics division at <b>GIVI UniBS MotoStudent
						Team</b>, I have
					the opportunity to develop and test innovative ideas in a dynamic environment.
				</p>
				<p>During my studies, I developed a strong interest in <b>competitive programming</b> and
					<b>problem-solving</b>,
					which led me to participate in the <b>IEEXtreme competition</b>‚Äîan intense global coding challenge.
					This
					experience enhanced my skills in <b>algorithm development</b>, <b>efficiency optimization</b>, and
					<b>teamwork</b>.
				</p>
				<p>Professionally, I have worked on developing <b>embedded boards</b> and <b>user interfaces</b> for
					<b>HVAC heat
						recovery devices</b>, gaining hands-on experience with <b>microcontrollers</b>, <b>PCB
						design</b>, and
					<b>firmware
						development</b> in an industrial setting.
				</p>
				<p>If you share similar interests or want to discuss exciting tech ideas, feel free to connect with me!

				<h3 class="major">Personal Projects</h3>

				<h4>Electric Scooter Conversion</h4>
				<p>I'm upgrading an electric scooter by replacing its original lead-acid batteries and 250W motor with a
					more powerful and efficient system. The new setup features a <b>48V 18650 lithium battery pack</b>
					and a <b>2kW three-phase asynchronous motor</b>, significantly improving performance and range.</p>

				<h4>Homelab Development</h4>
				<p>My homelab is built around a <b>Ryzen 5 5600G</b> with <b>16GB RAM @ 3200MHz</b>, a <b>Coral TPU</b>,
					and <b>6TB raw storage (3TB RAIDZ1)</b>. It hosts multiple services, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Home Assistant</b> (smart home automation)</li>
					<li><b>Frigate</b> (AI-powered security camera system)</li>
					<li><b>Omada Controller</b> (network management)</li>
					<li><b>Immich</b> (self-hosted photo management)</li>
					<li><b>Nextcloud</b> (private cloud storage)</li>
					<li>And more...</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="major">University Projects</h3>

				<h4>Givi MotoStudent Team</h4>
				<p>As part of the electronic team in the Givi MotoStudent project at UniBS, I contribute to modernizing
					the motorcycle's sensor data acquisition system. Our goals include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Developing custom sensor aggregator boards in-house</li>
					<li>Using a <b>Raspberry Pi 5</b> as the main controller with a touchscreen interface for the rider
					</li>
					<li>Integrating additional data sources like a weather station and a heart rate sensor</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>CyberChallenge.IT</h4>
				<p>I recently joined the <b>CyberChallenge.IT</b>, a national CTF-style cybersecurity competition. I'm
					currently getting familiar with the competition format and challenges.</p>

				<h4>IEEExtreme 2021</h4>
				<p>In 2021, I participated in <b>IEEExtreme</b>, a global programming competition that tests
					problem-solving skills across various topics.</p>

				<h2 class="major">Passions</h2>

				<h3>Photographyüì∑</h3>
				<p>For me, photography is more than just taking pictures‚Äîit's about capturing emotions, stories, and the
					thrill of a moment. Whether I'm out in nature shooting landscapes or trying to freeze the raw speed
					of a motorsport event, I love the challenge of finding the perfect angle, the right lighting, and
					the best composition. It‚Äôs my way of seeing the world differently and sharing my perspective with
					others.</p>

				<h3>Electronics Projectsüìü</h3>
				<p>Ever since I was a kid, I‚Äôve been fascinated by how things work. Tinkering with electronics lets me
					turn ideas into reality, whether it‚Äôs building circuits, working with microcontrollers, or
					automating tasks. I love the process of problem-solving, debugging, and eventually watching a
					project come to life. It‚Äôs that mix of creativity and technical skill that keeps me hooked.</p>

				<h3>Homelabsüåê</h3>
				<p>There's something deeply satisfying about designing and optimizing my own homelab. From setting up
					virtual machines to fine-tuning network configurations, I enjoy pushing the limits of what I can
					build at home. It‚Äôs not just about having a personal server‚Äîit's about experimenting, learning, and
					constantly improving my setup to make everything more efficient and secure.</p>

				<section>
					<h3>SportsüèÉüèª</h3>
					<p>I‚Äôve always been drawn to sports that challenge both the body and mind. They push my limits, fuel
						my competitive side, and give me an escape from the daily routine.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h4>Mountain Bikingüö¥üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h4>
							<p>There's no better feeling than flying down a trail, navigating technical descents, and
								pushing myself on the climbs. It‚Äôs a sport that demands focus, skill, and endurance, and
								I love every second of it.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>MotorsportüèéÔ∏è</h4>
							<p>The combination of speed, precision, and engineering fascinates me. Whether I‚Äôm watching
								a race, learning about vehicle dynamics, or trying my hand at simulations, I get
								completely absorbed in the world of motorsport.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Skiing‚õ∑Ô∏è</h4>
							<p>Nothing beats the thrill of carving through fresh snow, feeling the rush of cold air, and
								mastering new slopes. Skiing is pure freedom and adrenaline wrapped into one.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Swimmingüèäüèº</h4>
							<p>The water has always been my reset button. Whether I‚Äôm training, unwinding, or just
								enjoying the rhythm of each stroke, swimming keeps me grounded and helps me stay fit.
							</p>
